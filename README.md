# StrazPozarnaUI
Project made for recrutation, using React.js with Redux, Bootstrap + Sass and sigma.js for displaying nodes.
Hosted on : https://sigmatest.herokuapp.com/

## What does it actually do?
I was supposed to write a program that would represent following problem:
- We have cities that have firefighter station, and we have cities that don't
- Some cities are connected
- Firetrucks need time to travel from one city to another
- There's maximum time of travel, that firetrucks can't exceed
- Travel time is not dependent on direction of travel along the edge

My app has also option to import city graph from file: 'example.txt' provides you with information what's he correct format.

#### After adding cities and edges don't forget to click 'Colour Nodes Properly'
